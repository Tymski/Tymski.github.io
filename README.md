Hello World! Tymski here with yet another website. You can hopefully find some stuff useful for you. I'm writing this very description for the future, so there is not much on the site yet. I will make a web development tutorial section for beginners and intermediete creators, because I'm not an expert yet. I like to share my ideas with the Internet People, so there will be posts here about my projects. I make some games so I think I can provide a little bit of entertainment alongside teaching you a thing or two. Fun and practical, that's my motto.  
Game creation is my jam, so I participated on some game jams, I will make overwiew of some of the games, share the code, ideas, graphics and so on. Some of them will have tutorials, step by step instructions or something like this.

## Web projects:
todo: list my projects, like https://tymski.github.io/10minutes an online timer.

## External resources:
todo: list my channels and blog posts  
I killed my Polish blog for now and I just started writing some stuff in English. https://tymski.wordpress.com/ has like 3 posts that are worth reading and two of them are on programming, so you can definitelly check them out.

## Computer Graphics
I make some CG when I have the time to do so. I post some graphics on Pixabay, free to download, use and whatever. https://pixabay.com/en/users/TymonOziemblewski-1587333/

## Games
* Super Hamner on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Tymski.HikingOverIt Super Hammer is hard to play and easy to master arcade game. There are 10 levels as of writing this and I will develop a 2.0 version at some point. For now however, you can challenge yourself and try to climb some mountains with a hammer.

## YouTube Channels
* Tutorialspot https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtNoHe-G5sxGz2C2iB2u9zQ
* Tymski https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWs-YiCcT7QIEk_FRfUg0Q

## Social Media profiles:
* Twitter: https://twitter.com/Tymski That profile is basicly spammed by youtube links as I allowed youtube to share any video I like and over the years I watched a ton of videos. You can find hidden treasure there. Videos about science, computer graphics, funny videos, guitar music, Blender, Magic: the Gathering, game dev tutorials, metal music, programming and so on.
* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/tymon.oziemblewski I deleted most of my public things, but there will be some stuff I created. Also a good way to communicate with me on messenger. I answer to "other" messeges if you want to talk.

## TODO:
* work on this readme file!
* work on the website!
* make good content!
