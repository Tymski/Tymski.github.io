Hello World! Tymski here with yet another website. You can hopefully find some stuff useful for you. I'm writing this very description for the future, so there is not much on the site yet. I will make a web development tutorial section for beginners and intermediete creators, because I'm not an expert yet. I like to share my ideas with the Internet People, so there will be posts here about my projects. I make some games so I think I can provide a little bit of entertainment alongside teaching you a thing or two. Fun and practical, that's my motto.

## Web projects:
